#You want to take a list of numbers and 
#find the sum of all of the even numbers 
#in the list. Ignore any odd numbers.
#Task:

#Find the sum of all even integers in a 
#list of numbers.


#Define the length of the array
n = int(input())
#define the variable that will add all the even values
sum = 0
#Run through the arrays length.
for i in range(n):
#Define all the values in the whole array
    element = int(input())
#Check is the value we just gave is odd or even
    if element % 2 == 0:
#if the value we defined is even, we add them in the sum variable
        sum += element
#Print the final sum of all the even numbers
print(sum)
